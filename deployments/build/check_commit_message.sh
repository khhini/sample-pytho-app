# ^cd.* - Starts with "cd" followed by any characters
# ^chore(infra).* - Starts with "chore(infra)" followed by any characters
# ^chore(permission).* - Starts with "chore(permission)" followed by any characters
# The || operator in the user's request implies an OR condition.
# In regex, this is represented by the | character.

# `grep -E` enables extended regular expressions.
# `grep -q` suppresses output, we only care about the exit status.
